%TOC%

---++ Syntax Rules

You have to create topic *%Your_user_name%NotifyList* in *Main* web from template Main.NotificationPluginListTemplate. Fill it with desired topics, webs and regexps and enjoy...

%ICON{edittopic}% <a href="%SCRIPTURLPATH%/edit%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%WIKIUSERNAME%NotifyList?templatetopic=Main.NotificationPluginListTemplate"><strong>Create <nop>%WIKIUSERNAME%NotifyList now!</strong></a>.

---+++ NTF variable
For adding _fast switching_ to notifications you can use =%<nop>NTF{}%= variable:

You should add this variable to =view.tmpl= (you can use view.tmpl bundled in <nop>NotificationPlugin.zip). The buttons are !JavaScript-ed so you need to have !JavaScript enabled in your browser.

You can use these attributes in =%<nop>NTF{}%= variable:
	* =popup= - if displays button which opens new window with support of changing notifications
	* =tin= - it displays button for changing 'Topic immediate notifications'
	* =win= - it displays button for changing 'Web immediate notifications'
	* =tn= - it displays button for changing 'Topic notifications'
	* =wn= - it displays button for changing 'Web notifications'

Default values for all these attributes are "on". You can set it "off" to hide buttons.

---++++ NTF examples
	* =%<nop>NTF{}%= - displays all four buttons
	* =%<nop>NTF{win="off" wn="off"}%= - displays only buttons for topic immediate notification and regular topic notification

---++ Description of <nop>NotifyList topics

There are two types of notifications - immediate and regular.

---+++ Type of notifications

---++++ Immediate notifications
This type of notifications is send immediatly after user change watched topic. This type of notification is send also in the case user use 'Don't notify' checkbox. This means that you can see ANY change which is made in selected topics or webs. But, on the other hand, this is also the best way to be spammed with many mails if you set immediate notification on whole webs if topics in this web are often changed. You have to decide when to use this type of notification.

---++++ Regular notifications
This type of notifications is the default Foswiki notification system. The problem with this type of notifications is when somebody use "Don't notify" option because notification is not send (what is logical :-)). But sometimes you want to know about every change in your topic and then the immediate notifications come into play...

---+++ Subtypes
The syntax of setting a notification is with bullet Foswiki list.

*Example:*
If you put following line in "Topic immediate notifications" section when anybody change this topic you will get notification about the change:
	* Main.WebHome
If you want to set immediate notifications on web _Foswiki_ add this line under "Web immediate notifications":
	* Foswiki
If you want to set immediate notifications on all topics in web Test and topics which contains string 'Design' in the name add following line in "Regex immediate notifications":
	* Test\..*Design

---++ TODO

	* Add child notifications (setting an topic and get notifications of all its children)
